                <h3>A Little Information About Our Lead Downrigger Weights</h3>
                <p>In the fabrication of our downrigger weights we use the very best raw materials and components available. 
                    Although the lead used to make our weights is obtained from industrial scrap, we
                    strive to keep the percentage of pure lead in our finished weights as close to 100% as possible. </p>
                    <p>Be assured we are extremely vigilant when purchasing any scrap lead, therefore, prior to
                    purchasing we personally inspect every lot that comes into our manufacturing facility. We do
                    not purchase or accept low quality lead mixtures (wheel weights, lead from batteries or ingots
                    poured by others) that could adversely affect the quality of our weights. The fact is, the lower
                    the percentage of pure lead used to make lead weights, the harder and less durable they are.
                    We also purchase and use the best solid brass eyelets available and they are rated at 600 lbs.
                    tensile strength. </p>
                    <p>“Hard casting” of lead is different from using hard lead in the normal production of lead fishing
                    sinkers. During fabrication of our downrigger weights, we use an essential technique which has
                    to do with mold temperature combined with liquefied lead temperatures. The brass eyelets are
                    set into the mold prior to pouring the lead and become an integral part of the weight when the
                    lead has cooled. </p>
                    <p>The weights to be coated are then delivered to a licensed firm that specializes in coating
                    unusual and unique items. The durable eco-friendly coating is professionally applied hot and
                    under pressure with one layer covering the entire weight followed by a second layer applied to
                    the bottom of each weight, then set aside to cool gradually which allows for a hardened finish.
                    This exclusive process is accomplished entirely in the U.S.A. and is patent pending. </p>
                    <p>The primary design of our weights combined with our exceptional coating process produces an
                    unequivocal durable and eco-friendly lead downrigger weight. Anglers have acknowledged
                    overall satisfaction and confidence after purchasing and using the finest downrigger weight
                    available to assist getting their presentation down to depths where the fish are and most
                    importantly, stay at that depth with minimal “blow back” at all trolling speeds.</p>
